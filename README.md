This project builds a Linear Regression model to predict house prices using the California Housing dataset (similar to Boston Housing).

Features Used

The dataset contains:

Median income

House age

Avg rooms & bedrooms

Population

Latitude & Longitude

And other location-based features

Steps in the Project

Load Dataset using fetch_california_housing()
Split Data into training and testing sets
Train Linear Regression Model
Predict House Prices
Evaluate Model
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R² Score
Display Coefficients for all features

Model Evaluation Metrics

MSE: Measures prediction error

R² Score: Shows how well the model fits the data

Higher R² → Better model performance
